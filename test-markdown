# Favorite Movies

My name is Jame, and my favorite movies are often directed by Ridley Scott. I like the SciFi genra and Mr Scott has the ability to create movies that are timless, in that they feel as current and fresh now as when they where originally filmed.

Sir Ridley Scott (born 30 November 1937) is an English film director and producer. 

Well known films of his include:

* Alien (1979)
* Blade Runner
* Gladiator 
* The Martian. 

Part of his expertise is in creating scenes that people still talk about today. Like the scene below where the alien is 'born'.
